# Uniswap v4 Quick‑Start Hook Examples

The Uniswap v4 documentation includes a set of **quick‑start** hook examples designed to teach developers how to extend the protocol.  These examples are **not** deployed contracts; instead they illustrate how to implement custom logic using the hook interfaces.  The examples provide starter templates for three categories of hooks:

| Example Hook | Description | Key Points | Source |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| **SwapHook** | Demonstrates how to count the number of times `beforeSwap` and `afterSwap` are invoked.  The example contract inherits from `BaseHook` and declares two mappings (`beforeSwapCount` and `afterSwapCount`) keyed by pool ID.  The `getHookPermissions` function is overridden to enable only `beforeSwap` and `afterSwap` hook entry points.  Each time a swap is executed, the relevant counter is incremented. | Shows how to override `beforeSwap` and `afterSwap` methods and how to set hook permissions for swap hooks. | [Uniswap docs – Swap Hooks](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/quickstart/hooks/swap) |
| **LiquidityHook** | Provides a template for tracking the number of times liquidity is added to or removed from a pool.  The contract defines `beforeAddLiquidityCount` and `beforeRemoveLiquidityCount` mappings.  `getHookPermissions` is overridden to enable `beforeAddLiquidity` and `beforeRemoveLiquidity`.  During `beforeAddLiquidity`, the counter for that pool is incremented, and similarly for `beforeRemoveLiquidity`. | Illustrates how to implement hooks for adding and removing liquidity and how to select the correct hook permissions. | [Uniswap docs – Liquidity Hooks](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/quickstart/hooks/liquidity) |
| **AsyncSwapHook** | Shows how to implement an **asynchronous swap** by taking control of the swap accounting.  With AsyncSwap, the hook’s `beforeSwap` can take the entire input and return a `BeforeSwapDelta` so that Uniswap’s internal swap logic is skipped.  Developers can then implement custom swap logic or custom curves.  The example emphasises that only exact‑input swaps are supported, and warns that AsyncSwap hooks can be misused if not implemented carefully.  The hook must enable the `beforeSwapReturnDelta` permission to work. | Demonstrates advanced custom accounting and replacement of Uniswap’s swap logic; useful for implementing delayed or custom‑curve swaps. | [Uniswap docs – AsyncSwap Hooks](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/quickstart/hooks/async-swap) |

These examples serve as a useful starting point when designing your own hooks.  They do not have on‑chain addresses; to use them in practice, you must compile and deploy them alongside a PoolManager, assigning the appropriate hook permissions.
