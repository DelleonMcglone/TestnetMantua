# Mantua Protocol

**AI-Native OS for DeFi — Built for the Industry, Not a Single Chain**

Mantua Protocol is an **AI-powered programmable liquidity layer** designed for the entire DeFi ecosystem.
We combine **LLM-driven natural language interfaces** with **programmable liquidity hooks** and **autonomous DeFi agents**, enabling a new category we call **DeFiAI**: liquidity, trading, and portfolio management that’s conversational, adaptive, and intelligent.

> **Tagline:** Built for DeFiAI. Liquidity on autopilot.

## 🌟 Vision

DeFi today is fragmented, complex, and static. Mantua reimagines DeFi as **adaptive and intelligent infrastructure**:

* Liquidity that adjusts in real-time
* Agents that monitor and act autonomously
* Interfaces that work in natural language

---

## 🚀 Core Features

* **Programmable Liquidity** — Deploy adaptive strategies (dynamic fees, MEV protection, TWAP pricing, auto-rebalancing) via hooks.
* **Natural Language DeFi** — Swap, create pools, stake, and manage portfolios using chat.
* **AI Agents for Finance** — Spin up autonomous agents that execute trades, optimize yield, or monitor on-chain activity.
* **DeFiAI Layer** — The connective OS that fuses AI, liquidity, and DeFi infrastructure into one stack.
