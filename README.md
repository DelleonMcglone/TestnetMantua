# Mantua AI

**AI-Native OS for DeFi ‚Äî Built for the Industry, Not a Single Chain**

Mantua AI is an **AI-powered programmable liquidity layer** designed for the entire DeFi ecosystem.
We combine **LLM-driven natural language interfaces** with **programmable liquidity hooks** and **autonomous DeFi agents**, enabling a new category we call **DeFiAI**: liquidity, trading, and portfolio management that‚Äôs conversational, adaptive, and intelligent.
