{"prompt": "In Uniswap v4, how can I fetch a list of pools for a specific token like ETH? I’ve been exploring the documentation but can’t find a method to query pools by token.", "output": "Uniswap v4 doesn’t provide a direct function to enumerate pools by token.  In v4 all pools live in a single `PoolManager` contract and the pool metadata is stored in a mapping from `poolId` to a `PoolKey` structure【444436738854708†L139-L144】.  Because of this design you must already know the pool’s `poolId` to look up its currencies and fee tier; there is no on‑chain enumeration of pools by token.  To discover pools by token you need to use an indexing service (such as the official v4 indexer that powers v4.xyz) or query events off‑chain.  These indexers scan pool deployment events and return all pools that contain a specific token.  Once you have a pool’s `poolId`, you can read its state from `StateView` or `PoolManager`."}
{"prompt": "If I’m the only liquidity provider and deposit 100 USDT and 100 USDC into a new Uniswap v4 pool, what happens when someone swaps 10 USDC for 10 USDT? Will the pool automatically rebalance back to 100/100, and do I earn the trading fee?", "output": "Uniswap pools do not rebalance back to the initial deposit ratio.  When a trader swaps USDC for USDT, the reserves change (for example to roughly 90 USDT and 110 USDC).  The pool price stays at this new ratio until another swap moves it again.  Liquidity can only be withdrawn at the current reserve ratio; the protocol doesn’t force it back to the original 50/50 balance【694155202778803†L169-L177】.  Arbitrageurs are incentivised to trade the pool until its price matches the external market.  As the sole liquidity provider you’ll earn the swap fee from every trade, but the pool will not restore the 100/100 balance on its own."}
{"prompt": "I have a KTA/USDC pool on Base (v4) whose price is far from the real market price.  Even when I add concentrated liquidity around the correct price range I get no swaps.  How can I bring the pool price back into range so that other LPs will add liquidity?", "output": "Adding liquidity does not move the pool price; only swaps move the price.  In concentrated‑liquidity pools, liquidity provided outside the current price range sits idle as a single token until the price enters that range【466583239945500†L120-L149】.  Because your pool’s price is far from the market price, there is no active liquidity at the true price and therefore no trades occur.  The price will only change if someone actually trades against the pool or arbitrageurs move it back in line.  You cannot force the price back into range by adding liquidity.  In practice the options are to create a new pool at the correct price or wait for arbitrage to move the price; once there is active liquidity and volume, other LPs may join."}
{"prompt": "I’m exploring Uniswap v4 hooks.  Is it possible to implement a custom swap pricing logic (e.g., similar to Curve v2) via hooks without changing liquidity positions?", "output": "Yes.  Uniswap v4 introduces hooks—arbitrary smart contracts that can intercept actions such as adding liquidity, removing liquidity and swaps.  Hooks let developers build custom automated‑market‑maker logic and dynamic fee strategies around the core protocol【775560513122963†L63-L74】.  A hook can modify swap behaviour in `beforeSwap` or `afterSwap` by checking an oracle price and adjusting fees or liquidity accordingly.  For example, the QuickNode guide notes that hooks can create custom AMM curves and dynamic pricing logic【326581822990563†L73-L127】.  You can implement a Curve‑style pricing curve by writing a hook that adjusts balances or reintroduces virtual liquidity based on oracle prices.  The hook logic runs at swap time; it doesn’t require manual changes to LP positions, but you must deploy and register the hook when the pool is created."}
{"prompt": "How bad can impermanent loss be in a USDC/USDT stablecoin pair on Uniswap?", "output": "Impermanent loss is minimal in stablecoin pairs because both assets track the same value.  A BlockApps overview of impermanent loss notes that pairs of stable assets typically face minimal impermanent loss compared to volatile pairs【479900458399902†L120-L127】.  In a USDC/USDT pool the price should remain near 1‑to‑1, so any divergence between the two tokens is small.  However, if either stablecoin loses its peg the LP will suffer losses relative to holding the tokens outside the pool."}
{"prompt": "Is there any difference between providing liquidity to a WETH‑USDC pool and an ETH‑USDC pool in Uniswap v4?", "output": "Wrapped Ether (WETH) is simply an ERC‑20 representation of native ETH with a 1:1 value【538816220224859†L76-L103】.  In previous versions of Uniswap, pools required ERC‑20 tokens, so ETH had to be wrapped into WETH first.  Uniswap v4 supports native ETH pools, so you can provide ETH directly without wrapping.  Practically the pools behave the same—the price and fee structure are identical—except that the ETH‑USDC pool accepts native ETH and may save gas by skipping the wrap/unwrap step, while the WETH‑USDC pool uses the WETH token as usual."}
{"prompt": "How does Uniswap decide whether to route swaps to v3 or v4 pools?  As a liquidity provider, is there an advantage to choosing v4 over v3 for a basic LP position?", "output": "Uniswap’s routing algorithm searches across all available pools to find the best price for the trader.  V4 introduces several improvements over v3: a singleton architecture that reduces gas costs by keeping all pools in one contract【270531790977302†L92-L107】; plug‑in hooks for custom AMM curves and dynamic fees【270531790977302†L98-L122】; support for native ETH and unlimited fee tiers【270531790977302†L145-L156】; and the ability to set dynamic fees at pool creation【270531790977302†L199-L207】.  Traders will prefer the pool offering the best execution, so the router may choose a v4 or v3 pool depending on liquidity, fees and hooks.  As an LP, v4 can offer better capital efficiency (through hooks and dynamic fees) and lower gas costs, but v3 pools remain widely used and may have deeper liquidity.  There is no one‑size‑fits‑all answer; LPs should compare pool depth, fee tier and available hooks on each version before deciding."}
{"prompt": "Can I collect only part of the fees from my Uniswap v3 liquidity position, or must I collect all fees at once?", "output": "Yes.  The Uniswap v3 `collect` function accepts `amount0Max` and `amount1Max` parameters that specify how much of the accrued fees to withdraw.  The official example sets both to the maximum value to collect all fees【321945496416618†L105-L140】, but you can pass smaller values to collect only a portion.  The unused fees remain in the position and continue to accumulate until you collect them later."}
{"prompt": "How do platforms like Uniswap quickly find the best cross‑chain bridge for a given asset?", "output": "Uniswap integrates cross‑chain bridging through Across Protocol.  Across uses an intents‑based system: when a user initiates a bridge, a relayer observes the intent, executes the transfer on the destination chain and is later reimbursed on the source chain.  Across bundles many deposits into a single transaction to reduce fees and uses a decentralized network of relayers to provide fast and secure bridges【670921904644087†L63-L97】.  Because the bridging is integrated directly into the Uniswap interface, the app can automatically choose the optimal route based on liquidity and relay fees.  Users don’t need to select a bridge manually—the system compares available routes and executes the cheapest, fastest option."}
{"prompt": "The APR shown for my liquidity position doesn’t match what I actually earn.  Why is the APR so different from my expected returns?", "output": "Displayed APR figures are often based on short‑term fee generation and assume constant trading volume and price.  A chapter on concentrated‑liquidity strategies explains that fee APR peaks in the first 48 hours and declines as the price moves out of range or swap volume falls.  The book gives several formulas for calculating fee APR and warns that high headline numbers from some DEXs can be misleading【716096119041590†L160-L210】.  To compute your real APR you should track your accrued fees over time relative to the USD value of your liquidity and adjust for periods when your position is out of range.  In practice, APRs fluctuate and often decline as markets stabilize, so they rarely match the initial displayed rate."}
{"prompt": "Is there a way to get a list of all liquidity providers and their amounts for a Uniswap v4 pool?", "output": "Uniswap v4 itself doesn’t expose a list of liquidity providers.  Like v3, LP positions are separate positions managed by a position manager contract.  To enumerate holders you must use an indexing service or subgraph.  In the v3 subgraph the `Pair` (v2) or `Pool` (v3) entity has a `liquidityPositions` relation that points to `LiquidityPosition` entities storing each provider’s balance【279977844933314†L166-L178】.  Each liquidity position includes the owner address and `liquidityTokenBalance`, and token entities include `derivedETH` fields for USD valuation【279977844933314†L145-L167】.  An equivalent v4 indexer (such as the official v4 indexer or Envio’s HyperIndex) provides similar data across chains.  Using such an API you can query all LP addresses and their liquidity amounts in batches."}
{"prompt": "How can I get the real‑time USD prices of token0 and token1 for any Uniswap v3 pair?", "output": "The Uniswap subgraph exposes several fields to derive dollar prices.  Each pool’s daily data (`poolDayDatas`) includes `token0Price` and `token1Price` fields, which represent the price ratio between the two tokens【45837069340440†L190-L210】.  To convert these ratios to USD, query the `Token` entity’s `derivedETH` field and multiply by the current ETH‑USD price【279977844933314†L145-L167】.  Many analytics sites (e.g., info.uniswap.org) perform this calculation automatically.  For tokens that lack a direct USD pool you can chain price feeds by first converting token0 to ETH via its `derivedETH` and then ETH to USD using an external price feed."}
{"prompt": "When adding liquidity in Uniswap, I can’t deposit my full amount in a single transaction and have to split it into many small transactions.  Why does this happen?", "output": "After researching available documentation there is no clear protocol‑level reason for forcing multiple liquidity deposits.  Uniswap doesn’t impose a limit on deposit size; large deposits should succeed as long as you have sufficient token balance, have approved the correct allowances, and set an appropriate slippage limit.  Repeated 'insufficient balance' or 'failed to fetch data' errors may be caused by wallet issues, network congestion or UI bugs, not by the core contracts.  In practice, ensure your wallet has enough ETH for gas, approve your tokens for the Position Manager contract, and try using another interface or network RPC.  There is no official fix documented for this issue."}
{"prompt": "I tried swapping DOK for Datai token on Uniswap.  Only the approval transaction appears on Etherscan; the actual swap didn’t happen and I never received the tokens.  What went wrong?", "output": "On Uniswap and other DEXs the first transaction (approval) simply grants the router permission to spend your tokens.  It does not execute the swap.  After approving, you must submit a second transaction to perform the actual swap.  An Ethereum StackExchange answer explains that an approval without a subsequent swap will not result in any token transfer【377339306357761†L184-L236】.  To complete the trade, return to the Uniswap interface after the approval succeeds and confirm the swap transaction.  Always verify that you signed and broadcast both transactions."}
{"prompt": "I want to create a Uniswap v4 hook that trades between an ERC‑20 and an ERC‑1155 token.  The PoolManager seems to assume only one token type.  Is this possible?", "output": "Uniswap v4 pools are still designed for two currencies, each represented by an address in the `PoolKey`.  The protocol uses ERC‑1155 internally for accounting (flash accounting) but does not support ERC‑1155 tokens as pool currencies.  A developer article clarifies that `Currency` in `PoolKey` is just an address representing an ERC‑20 or native ETH, while ERC‑1155 is used only for transient accounting【542112006438941†L70-L82】.  Therefore you cannot directly pair an ERC‑1155 token with an ERC‑20 in a v4 pool.  To trade ERC‑1155 assets you would need to wrap them into an ERC‑20 or build a custom protocol on top of Uniswap."}
{"prompt": "On Base network, querying `poolKeys` for my v4 pool ID returns nothing, yet `slot0` and `liquidity` queries succeed.  How can I retrieve the pool keys?", "output": "In Uniswap v4, pool keys are retrieved by calling the `poolKeys` function on the Position Manager with a 25‑byte `poolId`.  An answer on Ethereum StackExchange notes that calling `poolKeys` returns the currencies, fee, tick spacing and hooks for a pool【28865067493179†L171-L193】.  If you pass an incorrect or untrimmed `poolId`, the function returns empty data.  Ensure you’re using the correct `poolId` (a `bytes25` value) when querying.  For offchain reads, you can also use the `StateView` contract, which exposes `getSlot0` and other state reads for any pool ID【816751547733371†L120-L137】.  Hooked pools behave the same; there is no separate method for them."}
{"prompt": "When adding liquidity, the Uniswap frontend shows a price that differs from the protocol’s actual price, causing transaction failures.  How can I avoid this mismatch?", "output": "There is no official documentation explaining a persistent mismatch between the UI price and the protocol price.  Uniswap’s frontend derives prices from aggregated on‑chain data and can occasionally display stale or estimated values, especially for thinly traded pools.  If the on‑chain price moves before your transaction executes, it may fail.  To avoid this: check the pool’s current price using an on‑chain reader (`StateView` or a block explorer), set a higher slippage tolerance, or use another interface that provides real‑time quotes.  No specific protocol fix is documented for this issue."}
{"prompt": "When adjusting my WEETH/ETH range to enter an almost one‑sided position, I have to split the action into many small transactions.  Why won’t Uniswap let me adjust the entire range in one transaction?", "output": "The Uniswap documentation doesn’t describe any protocol‑level restriction on adjusting a full position in one transaction.  Users have reported needing multiple clips to adjust a range, but this appears to be a front‑end or wallet limitation rather than a smart‑contract requirement.  Large range adjustments involve multiple actions (decreasing the old range and minting the new one) and can hit gas or block gas limits if too much data is encoded.  Splitting the transaction into smaller operations reduces gas usage and avoids UI timeouts.  No definitive fix is documented; advanced users can interact directly with the Position Manager contract to perform a single `modifyLiquidities` call."}
{"prompt": "I built a Uniswap v4 pool with a custom hook, but it doesn’t appear on the global Uniswap interface.  How do I get a hooked pool indexed?", "output": "Uniswap v4 pools are indexed off‑chain.  The official v4 indexer (used by v4.xyz) is an open‑source multi‑chain indexer built with Envio HyperIndex that tracks pool statistics, volume and hooks【276691731561715†L56-L74】.  To have your custom hook pool show up, you need to ensure that your pool’s deployment event is indexed by a service like the official indexer, TheGraph or Envio.  Running your own indexer involves scanning pool creation events and storing metadata such as tokens, fee tier and hook address.  Until such services include your pool, it will remain invisible to the default interface."}
{"prompt": "I calculated liquidity for my hypothetical v4 position and got a very small number (e.g., 233) compared with on‑chain tick liquidity (~10^15).  How should I interpret this difference?", "output": "An Ethereum StackExchange answer explains that Uniswap v4 doesn’t record exact token balances during swaps to save gas.  The `liquidity` variable tracks the total active liquidity, while actual token balances are derived off‑chain.  To compute token amounts from a liquidity value you must process every position or initialized tick and calculate the amounts using helper functions such as `getAmount0Delta` and `getAmount1Delta`【468228435059420†L199-L207】.  The large on‑chain liquidity numbers represent scaled fixed‑point values, not raw token amounts; your calculation must convert between fixed‑point (Q64.96) and human units.  In short, you should use the provided helper libraries to convert liquidity to token amounts, and not compare the raw liquidity figure directly to simple calculations."}
{"prompt": "What is the difference between pooled liquidity and pool balances in Uniswap?", "output": "In Uniswap, pooled liquidity refers to the total liquidity contributed by all LPs within the active price ranges, represented by the `liquidity` value in the pool.  Pool balances refer to the actual reserves of each token held by the pool contract at the current price.  Because Uniswap uses concentrated liquidity, LPs can provide liquidity outside the current price range; these out‑of‑range tokens are held by the position manager contract and don’t appear in the pool’s reserves.  As a result, pooled liquidity can be high even if the pool’s current token balances are low.  When the price moves into a previously out‑of‑range position the corresponding tokens are transferred into the pool contract, increasing the reserves.  This conceptual difference isn’t clearly documented in a single source, but it follows from how concentrated liquidity positions work."}
{"prompt": "I’m developing a backend service that integrates with the Uniswap v4 router.  Are there any examples of logic used to find optimal routes and populate the `PathKey[]` calldata for swaps?", "output": "Uniswap v4 recommends using the Universal Router instead of interacting directly with the PoolManager.  The Universal Router is a gas‑efficient contract that executes complex swap operations across multiple protocols, including v4.  It abstracts away routing complexity and accepts encoded commands and parameters to perform swaps【220215273649172†L82-L100】.  To build backend routing you can look at the official `universal-router` repository, which includes examples of encoding commands.  There isn’t yet a public example of backend code that populates `PathKey[]` for v4 pools; most applications either rely on the Universal Router or wait for a dedicated routing API.  Your service will need to implement its own route discovery logic (e.g., using on‑chain quotes or an indexer) and then encode the commands for the Universal Router."}
{"prompt": "On testnet I interact with the PoolManager through an intermediary contract like PoolSwapTest.  What’s the proper way to interact with the PoolManager on mainnet and access parameters like `sqrtPriceLimitX96`?", "output": "For swaps on Uniswap v4 you generally shouldn’t call the PoolManager directly.  The protocol introduces the Universal Router—a flexible contract that handles swap execution on v4 pools.  The Universal Router acts as an intermediary between users and the PoolManager and is recommended for mainnet use because it abstracts the callback‑based swap flow【220215273649172†L82-L100】.  If you need to perform low‑level interactions, you can deploy your own intermediary contract that wraps PoolManager calls and manages callbacks.  However, for most developers the Universal Router or the Position Manager is the appropriate interface; these contracts expose parameters such as `sqrtPriceLimitX96` via helper libraries and provide easier scripting."}
{"prompt": "I added liquidity incorrectly on Base and can’t view or remove my position on the Uniswap UI, but I still see the NFT.  How can I remove the liquidity?", "output": "Uniswap v4 positions are managed by the Position Manager contract.  Even if the UI doesn’t display a position, you can still interact with the contract directly.  The v4 Position Manager uses a command‑based interface where actions such as `DECREASE_LIQUIDITY` (action 0x01) and `TAKE_PAIR` (action 0x11) are combined and executed in a single call【774413642336892†L84-L114】.  To remove liquidity you need the position’s ID (or salt) and then construct a `modifyLiquidities` call that decreases liquidity and settles the pair.  Tools like Viem, Foundry or Hardhat can encode these calls.  The current UI may not show Base positions due to indexing issues, but the underlying contract still allows you to withdraw."}
{"prompt": "I’m trying to remove my Uniswap v3 liquidity via OKX’s web interface, but the option is disabled.  How can I remove my liquidity?", "output": "There is no known protocol restriction that prevents removing liquidity through third‑party interfaces; if the UI you’re using disables the action, it’s likely a front‑end limitation.  To remove your position you can use the official Uniswap interface or another wallet that supports Uniswap v3 liquidity removal.  Alternatively, you can interact directly with the `NonfungiblePositionManager` contract and call `decreaseLiquidity` followed by `collect` using your position’s tokenId.  No official documentation states why OKX’s interface disables this, so switching interfaces or using a direct contract call is the practical workaround."}
{"prompt": "My Uniswap v4 liquidity position isn’t detected in the app.  What can I do?", "output": "Uniswap v4 positions are not ERC‑721 NFTs like in v3; they are tracked by a salt and stored in the Position Manager.  The interface may fail to display your position if the indexer hasn’t processed your transaction.  You can still read and manage the position directly via the Position Manager contract.  Use the pool’s `poolId` and your salt to query `getPosition` or read the deltas via `StateView`.  If you want to withdraw or modify the position, construct the appropriate `modifyLiquidities` call.  There is no official fix for the UI issue at this time."}
{"prompt": "If I set a price range of $2–$6 on a v4 LP position and the price moves from $2 to $6, will my liquidity be withdrawn at the midpoint ($4)?", "output": "No.  Uniswap LP positions are withdrawn at the current price, not the midpoint.  When you remove liquidity you receive each token in the same ratio as the pool’s reserves at that moment【694155202778803†L169-L177】.  If the price moves from $2 to $6, you will withdraw tokens at the $6 price point (i.e., mostly the higher‑priced token), not half at $4.  The midpoint has no effect on withdrawals; it simply defines the range within which your liquidity is active."}
{"prompt": "Is there a way to collect my LP fees when I can’t see my liquidity position in the Uniswap interface?", "output": "Yes.  In v3 the `collect` function on `NonfungiblePositionManager` allows you to withdraw fees from a position even if the UI doesn’t display it.  You call `collect` with your position’s tokenId and specify the amounts you want to collect; any uncollected fees remain【321945496416618†L105-L140】.  In v4 you can achieve the same by using the Position Manager’s command‑based interface: after decreasing liquidity (if desired), encode a `collect` action to withdraw fees.  As long as you have the position ID you can collect fees directly from the contract."}
