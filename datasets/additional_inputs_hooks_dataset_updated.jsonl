Address: N/A. Description: A limit‑order hook enforces a specific price range for swaps, transforming a Uniswap pool into a hybrid AMM/order book. Range orders approximate limit orders by providing a single asset within a specified price range and earn fees while waiting【375697187502823†L65-L74】. The hook’s `beforeSwap` checks the current price and only executes the swap when the price falls within the user‑defined limit. Notes: Limit‑order hooks allow traders to set precise execution prices but may leave orders unfilled if prices reverse; they also earn fees while waiting.
