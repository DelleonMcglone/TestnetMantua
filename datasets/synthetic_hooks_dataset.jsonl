{"prompt": "What does the DynamicFeePoolHook hook do?", "completion": "Category: DynamicFeeExample. Address: N/A. Description: Implements a dynamic fee mechanism that adjusts swap fees based on market volatility and trade size, increasing fees during high volatility and lowering them when conditions are stable【172126337518783†L61-L83】. Notes: Illustrative example from Uniswap v4 docs; this hook must be deployed as part of a custom pool."}
{"prompt": "Explain how the SwapHook works.", "completion": "Category: UniswapExample. Address: N/A. Description: Counts the number of times `beforeSwap` and `afterSwap` are invoked for each pool.  It overrides the hook permissions to enable only swap callbacks and increments counters on each call【172126337518783†L61-L115】. Notes: Tutorial example in the Uniswap v4 quick‑start guide; not a deployed contract."}
{"prompt": "What does the LiquidityHook hook do?", "completion": "Category: UniswapExample. Address: N/A. Description: Tracks the number of liquidity additions and removals by overriding `beforeAddLiquidity` and `beforeRemoveLiquidity` and incrementing counters for each pool【172126337518783†L61-L115】. Notes: Example hook from Uniswap’s quick‑start docs; must be deployed to be used."}
{"prompt": "Explain how the AsyncSwapHook works.", "completion": "Category: UniswapExample. Address: N/A. Description: Demonstrates asynchronous swaps by taking control of swap accounting.  In `beforeSwap` it returns a delta to bypass Uniswap’s internal swap logic, enabling custom curves or delayed execution【172126337518783†L61-L115】. Notes: Tutorial example; requires the `beforeSwapReturnDelta` permission and must be deployed."}
{"prompt": "What does the LiquidityPenaltyHook hook do?", "completion": "Category: OpenZeppelin. Address: N/A. Description: Penalizes just‑in‑time liquidity provision by withholding fees from positions added recently and applying penalties when liquidity is removed too soon, redistributing the penalty to other LPs【172126337518783†L61-L115】. Notes: Part of OpenZeppelin’s Uniswap hooks library; deploy this contract before using."}
{"prompt": "Explain how the AntiSandwichHook works.", "completion": "Category: OpenZeppelin. Address: N/A. Description: Implements a sandwich‑resistant design by recording pool state at the start of each block and ensuring that intra‑block swaps cannot get better prices than those available at block start, thereby deterring MEV sandwich attacks【172126337518783†L61-L115】. Notes: Provided by OpenZeppelin; must be compiled and deployed to use."}
{"prompt": "What does the LimitOrderHook hook do?", "completion": "Category: OpenZeppelin. Address: N/A. Description: Enables on‑chain limit orders by letting users supply liquidity at a target tick outside the current price.  Orders fill when the price crosses the target tick; accrued fees are added back to the order when topped up or cancelled【172126337518783†L61-L115】. Notes: OpenZeppelin library hook; requires deployment."}

{"prompt": "What does the VerifiedPoolsBasicHook hook do?", "completion": "Category: HookRankBase. Address: 0x5cd525c621afca515bf58631d37d3bfa7b72aae4. Description: Ensures that pools meet verification criteria before trading, promoting safer liquidity pools. Notes: Popular on Base for compliance and safety checks."}

Description: A small hook designed to accumulate BTC through small pools and swaps, providing steady exposure to BTC. Notes: Less active than other Hook Rank hooks but caters to BTC accumulation strategies."}
{"prompt": "What does the SpawnerHook hook do?", "completion": "Category: HookRankBase. Address: 0xb476c448da4453208df4e371fee26f4e630d3044. Description: Creates new pools or positions automatically and collects protocol fees; it has a high pool count and notable fee generation. Notes: Ranked due to its extensive deployment on Base."}
