{"prompt": "What does the DynamicFeePoolHook hook do?", "completion": "Category: DynamicFeeExample. Address: N/A. Description: Implements a dynamic fee mechanism that adjusts swap fees based on market volatility and trade size, increasing fees during high volatility and lowering them when conditions are stable\u3010172126337518783\u2020L61-L83\u3011. Notes: Illustrative example from Uniswap v4 docs; this hook must be deployed as part of a custom pool."}
{"prompt": "Explain how the SwapHook works.", "completion": "Category: UniswapExample. Address: N/A. Description: Counts the number of times `beforeSwap` and `afterSwap` are invoked for each pool.  It overrides the hook permissions to enable only swap callbacks and increments counters on each call\u3010172126337518783\u2020L61-L115\u3011. Notes: Tutorial example in the Uniswap v4 quick\u2011start guide; not a deployed contract See https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/quickstart/hooks/setup for deployment instructions."}
{"prompt": "What does the LiquidityHook hook do?", "completion": "Category: UniswapExample. Address: N/A. Description: Tracks the number of liquidity additions and removals by overriding `beforeAddLiquidity` and `beforeRemoveLiquidity` and incrementing counters for each pool\u3010172126337518783\u2020L61-L115\u3011.

{"prompt": "Explain how the AsyncSwapHook works.", "completion": "Category: UniswapExample. Address: N/A. Description: Demonstrates asynchronous swaps by taking control of swap accounting.  In `beforeSwap` it returns a delta to bypass Uniswap\u2019s internal swap logic, enabling custom curves or delayed execution\u3010172126337518783\u2020L61-L115\u3011. Notes: Tutorial example; requires the `beforeSwapReturnDelta` permission and must be deployed See https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/quickstart/hooks/setup for deployment instructions."}
{"prompt": "What does the LiquidityPenaltyHook hook do?", "completion": "Category: OpenZeppelin. Address: N/A. Description: Penalizes just\u2011in\u2011time liquidity provision by withholding fees from positions added recently and applying penalties when liquidity is removed too soon, redistributing the penalty to other LPs\u3010172126337518783\u2020L61-L115\u3011. Notes: Part of OpenZeppelin\u2019s Uniswap hooks library; deploy this contract before using."}
{"prompt": "Explain how the AntiSandwichHook works.", "completion": "Category: OpenZeppelin. Address: N/A. Description: Implements a sandwich\u2011resistant design by recording pool state at the start of each block and ensuring that intra\u2011block swaps cannot get better prices than those available at block start, thereby deterring MEV sandwich attacks\u3010172126337518783\u2020L61-L115\u3011. Notes: Provided by OpenZeppelin; must be compiled and deployed to use."}
{"prompt": "What does the LimitOrderHook hook do?", "completion": "Category: OpenZeppelin. Address: N/A. Description: Enables on\u2011chain limit orders by letting users supply liquidity at a target tick outside the current price.  Orders fill when the price crosses the target tick; accrued fees are added back to the order when topped up or cancelled\u3010172126337518783\u2020L61-L115\u3011. Notes: OpenZeppelin library hook; requires deployment."}
