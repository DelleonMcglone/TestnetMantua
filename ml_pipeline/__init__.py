"""Machine‑learning pipeline package.

This package contains scripts and utilities for collecting data,
generating features, training models and clustering user behaviour.

Each module is self‑contained and can be run independently.  For example,
`python data_ingestion.py --help` will list the available arguments for
downloading and storing historical volatility data.
